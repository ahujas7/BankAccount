# Bank Account

This bank account application was created using Java along with the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing packages. 

Overall, this project was created with the intent to potentially simulate the software in an ATM machine, by allowing the user to perform basic operations such as:
  - Create new accounts
  - Check the account balance
  - Withdraw and deposit funds
  - Make changes to their password
  - Transfer funds to other accounts
  - Delete an account
  
It is important to note that the Graphical User Interface (GUI) created is not very visually appealing. 
This project's main focus was functionality and to serve as a learning opportunity rather than user interface design.
